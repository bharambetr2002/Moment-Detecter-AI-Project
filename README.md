# Motion Detection using OpenCV

This Python project uses OpenCV to detect motion in a video file and draws bounding boxes around moving objects. It's a simple yet practical example of motion detection for various applications, including surveillance, security, and more.

## Features

- Motion detection using frame differencing and thresholding.
- Bounding boxes drawn around moving objects.
- Real-time monitoring of detected moments.
- User-friendly and easily customizable.

## How it Works

The code uses the following steps to detect motion in a video:

- Load a video file.
- Initialize the first frame and preprocess it.
- Continuously read frames, apply motion detection, and draw bounding boxes.
- Display the frames in real-time with detected moments.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library)

You can install OpenCV using pip:

```shell
pip install opencv-python
```
